Yeah, I'm Bob, and oh yeah, this is by the way a job interview, self-introduction thingy,
so please tidy it up, okay?
Like I said, I'm Bob and I'm 27 years old.
Also in fact, I'm living in the US, I like hockey, of course baseball too.
I really like soccer, leave that soccer part out.
I hope to hear from them soon, bye!
